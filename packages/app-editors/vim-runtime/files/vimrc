" You can override any of these settings on a global basis via the
" "/etc/vim/vimrc.local" file, and on a per-user basis via the "~/.vimrc" file.
" You may need to create those files.

" {{{ General Settings
set nocompatible                " use vim defaults (much better!)
set backspace=indent,eol,start  " allow backspacing over everything in insert mode

set history=50                  " keep 50 lines of command history
set ruler                       " show the cursor position all the time

" suffixes are given a lower priority when performing tab completion for files.
" The following extensions are less likely to be files that are desired to be
" read
set suffixes=~,.aux,.bak,.dvi,.lo,.o,.out,.swp
" }}}

" {{{ Locale Settings
" Honour the BOM, check for UTF-8, and fallback to the latin character set if we
" have a unicode enabled language.
if v:lang =~ "utf8$" || v:lang =~ "UTF-8$"

" {{{ Modeline Settings
" disable modelines by default as it has historically been a source of
" security vulnerabilities in vim.  securemodelines provides a secure
" alternative, and is a package suggestion on exherbo.
"
" You can re-enable this functionality by adding "set modeline" to the
" appropriate vimrc.
